excerpt: 'Political ads on polarizing topics, such as gun control and abortion rights, play a critical role in influencing public opinion. In this study, we analyze political ads published on Facebook, focusing on their content types, political leanings, and stances. Leveraging various large language models (LLMs), we investigate how advertisers strategically incorporate emotions—such as fear, anger, and sadness—and thematic elements to engage audiences and maximize impressions. Our findings highlight the deliberate use of emotional and thematic strategies tailored to specific objectives, such as shaping attitudes or driving actions. By examining these patterns, we provide insights into how advertisers combine content, emotions, and themes to amplify their campaigns’ reach and effectiveness. This study lays the groundwork for understanding the role of emotion-driven appeals in digital political advertising and their broader societal implications'
