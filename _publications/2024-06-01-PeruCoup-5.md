excerpt: 'The events after the attempted coup in December 2022 consisted of protests in response to the decades of corruption within the Peruvian government. Several groups in underrepresented areas convened and exercised their right to protest and voice their opinion on social media. In reaction to the nationwide protests, clashes between the police and citizens led to numerous casualties. In this paper, we present a dataset of 43,697 TikTok video metadata published between November 20, 2022, and March 1, 2023, on the aftereffects of the attempted coup by former President Pedro Castillo. We further analyze the content within the metadata to gain insight into the discourse and reaction to the political crisis. The dataset will serve as a contributing source to motivate analyses that can benefit underrepresented groups in Peru.'
